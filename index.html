<h2>Lyrics</h2>
<h3>2. Lights Out</h3>
<pre>Mom  
Good night honey, I’ve got candy to hand out  
Sweet dreams, now I’ll turn the lights out!

Kid  
There’s only one chance a year to conquer the night  
But it’s always the same story, she turns out that dang light  
So I’m stuck in here thinkin’ and dreamin’ of Halloween  
Designing my own costume that will never be seen  
I know there’s something out there, a world outside this room,  
Though so far I only know its reflection in the moon  
But tonight will be different, I won’t go to sleep  
this time around I pick trick over treat  
See mom always told me, I’m her special little son  
Now it’s time for someone special to have a little fun.

Mom
Oh honey? One more thing -  
No matter how you’re feeling  
Or what you’re gonna do  
There will never be another  
who could be a better you!</pre>

<h3>3. And I'm gone</h3>
<pre>And I’m gone.</pre>

<h3>4. Be seen on Halloween</h3>
<pre>
Welcome to the Grooveyard  
Let me introduce you  
Come and meet my friends,  
join the skeleton crew!

First a real life ghost not just a sheet with some holes  
Though her love overflows it’s oh so hard to get close  
let yourself be seen  
On Halloween.

Ghost: Helloooo helloooooooooooooooo helooooo ooo oooooooohh helloooooooooo

Come to the trick or treat suite  
tour my spooktacular pad  
There's not a wax or wayne in sight  
So come out and take over the night

He’s a late-night DJ who can lay down a groove  
But he’s a great fright we’d say if the lighting improved  
let yourself be seen  
Werewolf: "Time to boogie, man!"

On Halloween  
Halloween

Werewolf: "One, two, three"  
Boo!
</pre>

<h3>6. Good Idea, Bad Execution</h3>
<pre>
Welcome to the show!

It's a good idea, but bad execution  
I'm thinking that's not a great solution  
Hey, so come and play!

Boy: how do you play?

Let's all tell 'em why they're an idiot  
Hear their bright ideas and why they didn't work  
Finally we see they're just a little bit.... dumb!

Boy: "What? Who would want to play-"

Tonight's first contestant is a monster of a man  
One bite from a werewolf had a-blown away his plan  
Da da da dum, he lost everything - got cursed by cosmic fate:  
The same moon that transforms him then illuminates his face

But he wouldn't give up easily; he had too much to lose  
So he plans out his revenge and waits until the next full moon  
Then he climbs up to the highest tree and jumps into the sky  
he sets his sights upon the moon with a fire in his eyes

He grabs ahold with all his power, here's the zero hour, it's beginning  
he digs his claws into the sides, his retribution satisfied, he's grinning  
And he rips it and whacks it and in one fell swoop,  
He sweeps it and swipes it and CRACKS it to the side,  
AND IT TURNS!!!!!!!!  
AND AS IT DOES THE PART OF HIM THAT GAVE HIM STRENGTH TO
CLIMB AND JUMP AND CLAW AND TEAR APART THE MOON WAS GONE!!!!!!  
AND HE COULD NOT HOLD ON!!!!!!!!!!!  
NO HE COULD NOT HOLD ON!!!!!

So come on down and let's all tell ‘em why! Two, three -  
It was a good idea, but bad execution  
I'm thinking that's not a great solution  
Hey, so come and play!

And let's all tell em why they're an idiot  
Hear their bright ideas and why they didn't work  
Finally we see they're just a little bit.... dumb!

Boy: No, this is a terrible game-

Next up is a lonely ghost who liked to be alive,  
She thought she wouldn't have to make new friends after she died  
da dum da dum. Now she's feeling down - to be alone is tough  
She wants her old friends back but they're not dying fast enough!!

And there's one guy in particular she misses most of all,  
He was charming, he was clever, he made winter feel like fall,  
She died too soon to tell him and they never got to be,  
She sees an opportunity to fulfill destiny!

She heads back into town, dressed up in her finest gown, she was stunning  
But as she floats on past, everyone becomes aghast, they start running,  
And she's moanin’ and wailin’ - in her desperation,  
She starts scarin’ and spookin', there's a mass migration,  
IT'S A GHOST TOWN!!!!!!!!  
SHE STOPS THERE WRAPPED IN SPACE AND SKY AND WONDERS HOW
THE ONLY LIFE SHE EVER KNEW AND ALL HER FRIENDS WERE GONE!!!!!!  
AND SHE COULD NOT MOVE ON!!!!!!  
NO SHE COULD NOT MOVE ON!!!!!!!

So come on down and let's all tell her why!!!  
Let's all tell her why!

-keyboard solo-

It's the good idea hall of fame!

Doors with hinges on the bottom  
A counterclockwise clock  
How 'bout online cash deposit  
And made-for-two-feet socks  
Why not an uneven staircase  
to trip burglars sneakin' in  
And lottery tickets  
Without a chance to win  
I'm thinkin' five finger nail clippers  
Sweaters for your fish  
Individually wrapped cereal or a  
washer for one dish, let's hear these...

...good ideas, with bad execution  
That's the thing we're lookin for, that's the right solution  
Like a floor-mounted shower head  
That sprays you from below  
Or a verbal traffic signal  
"stop stop stop, okay go!"  
...No doubt about it,  
We've got so much more in store!

Boy:
No! I just can't take any more!  
These are NOT good ideas,  
And this show isn't fun.  
I don't wanna play,  
And I'm not the only one.  
I'm gonna unplug the music  
Put an end to this scene  
I won't let you take away  
My first Halloween

Host: 
You think you call the shots?  
You're just a little boy!  
Now let's tell you why you're an idiot  
Turn the spotlights on - now you're in the thick of it  
Let's take a look at your GOOD IDEA!

Tonight's last contestant is a kid who's all alone,  
Wanting to feel big, he runs away from home -  
ba dum ba dum - do you feel safe?  
Isn't it obvious this was all a big mistake?  
What were you thinking? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?  
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
</pre>


<h3>7. Echoes of the Moon</h3>
<pre>

Werewolf: 
Turn the light out  
Don't shine it on me  
Turn the light out  
Don't let them see

Sample:
Paint the pipe, just do the world a favor  
it's not alright, to say you'll do it later  
paint the pipe, just do the world a favor  
it's not alright, to say you'll do it later

Werewolf:
The first time someone lays their eyes on me  
they run away  
The next time they see me.... well,  
maybe that'll happen someday

So every night I perform for myself  
At least the stars come out to see  
And maybe one day I'll find love  
Intergalactically

There used to be this comet,  
I would count the weeks till she flew by  
But every time she would say she's still waitin',  
Waitin' to meteorite guy!

-instrumental-

And that jealous moon's always there  
Feels like I just can't win  
When it starts to grow fat in the sides  
I know it'll happen again

So just try to like me when  
You have to bare your teeth to smile  
When emotion is read from a face  
I can only express something vile

And society longs for an outcast,  
They say opposites attract,  
but if you take pride in your self reliance,  
you won’t much impress the pack.

Oh no, not again!  
RAWRRRAGHHHHHH

Kid:
"I'm not afraid of you"  
"don't be afraid of me"  
kid takes off head of robot costume
"I'm here"  
</pre>


<h3>8. Give it a Try</h3>
<pre>
Kid  
Give it a try, be part of the world that surrounds you  
Open your eyes, look around, go outside  
One of these days, something good's gonna find you  
And life won’t pass you by

Ghost  
When I try to meet somebody  
they stare right through me  
And if they feel anything  
it’s only slightly gloomy

The last time that I opened up  
And didn’t have a thing to hide  
Was back when I was with you  
But that was on the other side  
The other side

Kid  
Give it a try, be part of the world that surrounds you  
Open your eyes, look around, go outside  
One of these days, something good will astound you  
And life won’t pass you by

- instrumental -

Ghost
I must admit I don’t see  
Why I need to change  
And what you’re asking me to do  
Well it sounds quite strange

The last time that I opened up  
And didn’t have a thing to hide  
Was back when I was with you  
But that was on the other side  
The other side

Kid 
Give it a try, be part of the world that surrounds you  
Open your eyes, look around, go outside  
One of these days, something good's gonna find you  
And life won’t pass you by

Everybody’s had some time that they felt better  
Close your eyes, remember back, look inside….  
And if you still think that your ship can’t stand the weather  
Well just hop on board mine

Let's go!

- instrumental -

I'm always by your side  
Yeah I'm always by your side  
I'll always be there for you  
You can be my spirit guide

(spoken) Cause so what? You died!  
Okay? Take it as a given  
You're in the after life  
why not start after livin!

So... you're gonna be just fine  
When you give it a go  
And the.... one thing I'll tell you  
's the one thing I know

NO MATTER HOW YOU'RE FEELIN'
OR WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH  
THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER  
WHO COULD BE A BETTER YOU!

NO MATTER HOW YOU'RE FEELIN' 
OR WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO  
THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER  
WHO COULD BE A BETTER YOU!
